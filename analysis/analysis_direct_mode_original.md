# Analysis: Horizon/Glance Direct Mode Upload Changes

## Original Inquiry

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Asked to:** @github-reviewer-agent  
**Query:**
```
please search for any work done with respect to Horizon/Glance and the changes made 
(CORS, httpd.conf, ..) to support direct mode upload by default
```

## Executive Summary

This analysis investigates the implementation of direct mode upload functionality in OpenStack Horizon and Glance, focusing on:
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration changes
- Apache httpd.conf modifications
- Direct upload vs. proxy upload modes
- Related code changes and configuration updates

**Status:** ðŸ”„ Awaiting response from @github-reviewer-agent

## Data Sources

- [ ] GitHub Pull Requests (horizon-operator, openstack-k8s-operators)
- [ ] OpenDev Reviews (openstack/horizon, openstack/glance)
- [ ] Configuration changes (CORS, httpd.conf)
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Background: Direct Mode vs Proxy Mode

### Proxy Mode (Traditional)
In proxy mode, image uploads flow through Horizon:
```
User Browser â†’ Horizon (Django) â†’ Glance API â†’ Storage Backend
```

**Drawbacks:**
- Horizon acts as intermediary, consuming resources
- Large uploads can overwhelm Horizon processes
- Memory and bandwidth intensive for Horizon server
- Slower upload speeds due to double transfer

### Direct Mode (Improved)
In direct mode, uploads go directly to Glance:
```
User Browser â†’ Glance API (direct) â†’ Storage Backend
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced load on Horizon
- Faster uploads (single transfer)
- Better for large images
- More scalable

**Requirement:**
- CORS must be properly configured on Glance
- Browser security policies require CORS headers
- httpd.conf may need proxy configuration updates

### Configuration Changes

#### CORS Configuration

Expected changes in Glance configuration:
```ini
[cors]
allowed_origin = https://horizon.example.com
allow_credentials = true
expose_headers = Content-Type,Cache-Control,Content-Language,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma,X-Auth-Token
allow_headers = Content-Type,Cache-Control,Content-Language,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma,X-Auth-Token,X-Subject-Token
```

#### Apache httpd.conf Changes

Expected changes for Horizon:
```apache
# Enable CORS headers for direct upload
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://glance.example.com"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"

# Proxy configuration updates
ProxyPass /api/glance http://glance-api:9292/
ProxyPassReverse /api/glance http://glance-api:9292/
```

## Testing and Verification

### How to Test Direct Mode

1. **Enable direct mode** in Horizon configuration
2. **Configure CORS** in Glance
3. **Upload a test image** via Horizon UI
4. **Check browser console** for CORS errors
5. **Verify upload** goes directly to Glance (check logs)

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check Glance CORS configuration
openstack-config --get /etc/glance/glance-api.conf cors allowed_origin

# Test CORS headers
curl -I -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: https://horizon.example.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  https://glance.example.com/v2/images

# Expected response should include:
# Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://horizon.example.com
# Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

## Conclusions

**[To be populated after github-reviewer-agent provides information]**

### Key Takeaways

1. Direct mode upload improves performance
2. CORS configuration is critical
3. httpd.conf changes may be needed
4. Testing is essential to verify browser compatibility

### Recommendations

1. âœ… Review CORS configuration carefully
2. âœ… Test with multiple browsers
3. âœ… Monitor Horizon resource usage (should decrease)
4. âœ… Document configuration for operators
5. âœ… Provide clear upgrade path

## Reproduction Steps

To research this topic:

```bash
# 1. Ask github-reviewer-agent
@github-reviewer-agent please search for any work done with respect to Horizon/Glance 
and the changes made (CORS, httpd.conf, ..) to support direct mode upload by default

## Appendix: Direct Mode Configuration Example

### Full Glance Configuration

```ini
[DEFAULT]
# ... other settings ...

[cors]
allowed_origin = https://horizon.example.com,https://horizon.alt.example.com
allow_credentials = true
expose_headers = Content-Type,Cache-Control,Content-Language,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma,X-Auth-Token,X-Subject-Token,X-OpenStack-Request-ID
allow_headers = Content-Type,Cache-Control,Content-Language,Expires,Last-Modified,Pragma,X-Auth-Token,X-Subject-Token,X-OpenStack-Request-ID
max_age = 3600
```

### Full Horizon Configuration

```python
# local_settings.py or local_settings.d/

# Enable direct upload to Glance
OPENSTACK_GLANCE_DIRECT_UPLOAD = True

# Glance endpoint for direct upload
GLANCE_ENDPOINT = 'https://glance.example.com:9292'
```

### Apache Configuration

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName horizon.example.com
    
    # Enable CORS for direct uploads
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://glance.example.com"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, X-Auth-Token, X-Subject-Token"
    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true"
    
    # ... rest of configuration ...
</VirtualHost>
```
