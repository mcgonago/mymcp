## Example Workflow

### Step 1: Copy Template

```bash
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/analysis
cp analysis_template.md analysis_cors_security.md

### Step 3: Query Agents

```bash
@github-reviewer-agent search for CORS security in openstack/horizon
@opendev-reviewer-agent analyze reviews about CORS configuration
```

### Step 4: Document Findings

Fill in sections as you gather information:
- Check off data sources used
- Add PR/review links as found
- Include code snippets
- Document testing procedures

### Step 5: Update Status

At the bottom:
```markdown

| **Copy Method** | Manual extraction | `cp` command |
| **Completeness** | Basic skeleton | Comprehensive sections |
| **Examples** | Minimal | Detailed placeholders |
| **Maintenance** | Update README | Update single file |
| **Discoverability** | Hidden in README | Listed in directory |
| **Version Control** | Mixed with README | Separate tracking |

## Current Analysis Directory

```
analysis/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Directory guide
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis_template.md         # üìù Template (copy this!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis_direct_mode.md      # Direct mode upload analysis (in progress)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SETUP_COMPLETE.md           # Initial setup documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TEMPLATE_CREATED.md         # This file
```

## Next Steps

### For New Analyses

1. Copy `analysis_template.md`
2. Rename to `analysis_<topic>.md`
3. Fill in sections as you research
4. Update `analysis/README.md` "Current Analyses" section
5. Commit when complete

### For the Direct Mode Analysis

The `analysis_direct_mode.md` file is already created and populated with:
- Background information
- Configuration examples
- Testing procedures
- Waiting for @github-reviewer-agent results

Once github-reviewer-agent responds, populate the findings sections.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Create new analysis
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/analysis
cp analysis_template.md analysis_<topic>.md

# Edit
vim analysis_<topic>.md

# Add to git
git add analysis_<topic>.md

# Update listing
echo "- **[analysis_<topic>.md](analysis_<topic>.md)** - Description" >> README.md

# Commit
git commit -m "Add analysis: <topic>"
```

## Template Evolution

The template can be enhanced over time:
- Add new sections as patterns emerge
- Include more examples
- Add links to tools and resources
- Refine based on user feedback

To update the template:
1. Edit `analysis/analysis_template.md`
2. Document changes in git commit
3. Notify team of improvements
