## Current Status

### Direct Mode Analysis

**Status:** üîÑ **Awaiting @github-reviewer-agent response**

**Original Query:**
```
@github-reviewer-agent please search for any work done with respect to 
Horizon/Glance and the changes made (CORS, httpd.conf, ..) to support 
direct mode upload by default
```

**Next Steps:**
1. ‚è≥ Wait for github-reviewer-agent to return results
2. üìù Populate analysis_direct_mode.md with findings
3. üîó Add links to specific PRs, commits, reviews
4. ‚úÖ Mark as complete

---

## How to Update the Analysis

Once github-reviewer-agent provides results:

### Step 1: Review the Response

Check what information was returned:
- GitHub PRs
- Commit references
- Configuration changes
- Related issues

### Step 2: Update analysis_direct_mode.md

Fill in the placeholder sections:

```bash
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/analysis
vim analysis_direct_mode.md
```

**Sections to populate:**
- `### GitHub Pull Requests` - Add PR links and descriptions
- `### Related OpenDev Reviews` - Add review links if found
- `### Code References` - Add specific file paths and commit SHAs
- `### Implementation Timeline` - Add dates from commits/PRs
- `### Known Issues and Workarounds` - Add any problems found
- `### Conclusions` - Summarize key findings

### Step 3: Update Status

Change the status from:
```markdown
**Status:** üîÑ Awaiting response from @github-reviewer-agent
```

To:
```markdown
**Status:** ‚úÖ Analysis complete
**Last Updated:** [Date]
```

---

## Template for Future Analyses

To create a new analysis:

```bash
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/analysis

# Copy the template structure
cp analysis_direct_mode.md analysis_<new-topic>.md

# Edit with your inquiry and findings
vim analysis_<new-topic>.md

# Update analysis/README.md to list the new analysis
vim README.md
```

---

## Integration with Workspace

The analysis directory complements the workspace:

| Directory | Purpose | Git Tracked | Lifespan |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **workspace/** | Temporary code checkouts for active reviews | ‚ùå No (gitignored) | Temporary |
| **analysis/** | Permanent documentation of research | ‚úÖ Yes | Permanent |

**Workflow:**
1. Use `workspace/` to fetch and examine reviews/PRs
2. Document findings in `analysis/`
3. Clean up `workspace/` when done
4. Keep `analysis/` for future reference

---

## Examples of Future Analyses

Potential topics for analysis documents:

- `analysis_django5_migration.md` - Django 5 upgrade work
- `analysis_integration_tests.md` - Integration test removal rationale
- `analysis_cors_security.md` - CORS security considerations
- `analysis_operator_architecture.md` - Kubernetes operator design
- `analysis_selenium_pytest_migration.md` - Test framework changes
- `analysis_microversions.md` - Nova/Cinder microversion support

---

## Quick Reference Commands

### Query MCP Agents

```bash
# GitHub
@github-reviewer-agent search for [topic] in [repo]

# OpenDev
@opendev-reviewer-agent analyze https://review.opendev.org/c/[project]/+/[number]

# GitLab
@gitlab-cee-agent analyze https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/[path]/-/merge_requests/[number]

# Jira
@jiraMcp search_issues jql="project = [PROJECT] AND text ~ '[search term]'"
```

### Document Findings

```bash
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/analysis
vim analysis_<topic>.md

# Include:
# - Original query
# - Data sources
# - Findings
# - Code references
# - Reproduction steps
```

### Verify and Commit

```bash
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp

# Check what changed
git status

# Add the analysis
git add analysis/

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add analysis: [topic description]

- Document [specific findings]
- Include [data sources]
- Provide [reproduction steps]
"

# Push to repository
git push origin main
```

## Next Actions

**For Direct Mode Analysis:**

1. ‚è≥ **Wait for @github-reviewer-agent** to return results about Horizon/Glance direct mode changes

2. üìù **Populate the analysis** with:
   - Specific PR numbers and links
   - Commit SHAs
   - Configuration file changes
   - Timeline of implementation
   - Testing procedures

3. ‚úÖ **Update status** to complete
