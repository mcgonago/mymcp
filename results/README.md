# Review Assessment Results

This directory contains review assessment documents generated by the workspace `fetch-review.sh` script.

## Purpose

When you fetch a review with `--with-assessment`, the script creates a structured assessment document here:
- `review_XXXXX.md` - Assessment for review/PR/MR number XXXXX

These assessments are:
- ✅ **Trackable** - Can be committed to git for permanent record
- ✅ **Structured** - Follow consistent template format
- ✅ **Cursor-ready** - Pre-filled with metadata, ready for AI analysis
- ✅ **Organized** - Separate from temporary workspace checkouts

## Usage

### Create Assessment

```bash
cd workspace
./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment opendev https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/965216
```

This creates `results/review_965216.md` with:
- Review metadata (author, date, files changed)
- Empty sections for Cursor to fill
- Comprehensive assessment template

### Complete Assessment

Ask Cursor to analyze:
```
Please analyze review 965216 and complete results/review_965216.md
```

Cursor will:
- Examine the code in `workspace/horizon-965216/`
- Fill in all assessment sections
- Provide final recommendation

### Review and Commit

```bash
# Review the assessment
cat results/review_965216.md

# Commit if valuable for permanent record
git add results/review_965216.md
git commit -m "Add assessment for review 965216"
```
