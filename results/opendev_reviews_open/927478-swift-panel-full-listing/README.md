## Review Information

- **Change ID**: 927478
- **URL**: https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/927478
- **Project**: openstack/horizon
- **Branch**: master
- **Status**: NEW
- **Created**: 2024-08-29
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
- **Files Changed**: 7 files
- **Changes**: +67/-8 lines (net +59 lines)

## High-Level Description of Changes

This change adds a new configuration option `SWIFT_PANEL_FULL_LISTING` to Horizon's Swift (object storage) panel. With 7 files modified and 59 net lines added, this represents a moderate feature addition that provides operators with control over how Swift objects are listed in the UI.

**Key Additions:**
- New configuration setting for Swift panel behavior
- Modified object listing logic in Swift panel
- Documentation and example configuration updates
- Test additions/modifications

**Notable**: This change has been open since August 2024, suggesting it may be addressing a long-standing need or has undergone significant discussion/iteration.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

**Swift Object Listing Challenges:**
Swift (OpenStack Object Storage) can contain thousands or millions of objects. Listing all objects can be:
- **Slow**: Fetching thousands of objects takes time
- **Resource-Intensive**: Server and network overhead
- **UI Performance**: Browser struggles with large datasets
- **User Experience**: Long wait times for page load

**Current Behavior (Without Full Listing):**
Most likely, Horizon uses paginated listing with a limit (e.g., first 1000 objects)
- **Pros**: Fast page loads, low resource usage
- **Cons**: Users can't see all objects at once, may miss objects

**With SWIFT_PANEL_FULL_LISTING Option:**
Operators can choose:
- **False (default)**: Paginated listing (current behavior, performant)
- **True**: Full listing (fetch all objects, potentially slow but complete)

**Use Cases for Full Listing:**
- **Small Deployments**: Few objects, full listing is fast
- **Complete Visibility**: Users need to see all objects without pagination
- **Specific Workflows**: Some users prefer complete lists over pagination

## How to Test This Change

Testing requires a Swift environment with varying numbers of objects to evaluate both configuration modes.

### Prerequisites
1. **Horizon Development Environment**: master branch with this patch
2. **Swift Deployment**: Accessible Swift/S3 API
3. **Test Data**: Multiple containers with varying object counts
4. **Configuration Access**: Ability to modify Horizon settings

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Create Test Data
```bash
# Create containers with different object counts

# Small container (10 objects)
openstack container create test-small
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "test content $i" | openstack object create test-small test-obj-$i
done

# Medium container (100 objects)
openstack container create test-medium
for i in {1..100}; do
  echo "test content $i" | openstack object create test-medium test-obj-$i
done

# Large container (1000+ objects)
openstack container create test-large
for i in {1..1500}; do
  echo "test content $i" | openstack object create test-large test-obj-$i
done
```

#### 2. Test with Full Listing DISABLED (Default)
Configure Horizon (in `local_settings.py`):
```python
SWIFT_PANEL_FULL_LISTING = False  # Or omit, if False is default
```

Restart Horizon:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

**Test:**
1. Navigate to **Project → Object Store → Containers**
2. **Open test-large container**
3. **Observe**:
   - How many objects are shown?
   - Is there pagination?
   - Is there a "Load More" button?
   - Check page load time (use browser Performance tab)
4. **Expected**: Limited listing, good performance

**Check Network Tab:**
```http
GET /v1/AUTH_{project}/test-large?limit=1000&marker=...
```
- Should see API calls with `limit` parameter
- May see multiple calls with `marker` for pagination

#### 3. Test with Full Listing ENABLED
Configure Horizon:
```python
SWIFT_PANEL_FULL_LISTING = True
```

Restart Horizon and clear browser cache.

**Test:**
1. Navigate to **Project → Object Store → Containers**
2. **Open test-large container**
3. **Observe**:
   - Are ALL 1500 objects loaded?
   - What's the page load time? (should be slower)
   - Check browser console for errors (large datasets can cause issues)
4. **Expected**: All objects listed, slower load time

**Check Network Tab:**
```http
GET /v1/AUTH_{project}/test-large
# OR multiple calls until all objects fetched
GET /v1/AUTH_{project}/test-large?marker=last-obj
GET /v1/AUTH_{project}/test-large?marker=another-obj
...
```
- Should see API calls fetching all objects (may be multiple calls with markers)

#### 4. Performance Comparison
Use browser developer tools → Performance tab:
- **Measure page load time** for both configurations
- **Compare network transfer size**
- **Monitor UI responsiveness**

**Create a comparison table:**
| Configuration | Objects | Load Time | Network Transfer | UI Responsiveness |
|---------------|---------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Full Listing OFF | 1500 | X seconds | Y KB | Good/Fair/Poor |
| Full Listing ON | 1500 | X seconds | Y KB | Good/Fair/Poor |

#### 5. Test UI Functionality
With each configuration:
- **Search/Filter**: Does object search work?
- **Upload**: Can you upload new objects?
- **Download**: Can you download objects?
- **Delete**: Can you delete objects?
- **Pagination Controls**: Are pagination controls shown/hidden appropriately?

#### 6. Test Edge Cases
- **Empty Container**: How does UI handle container with 0 objects?
- **Extremely Large Container**: What happens with 10,000+ objects with full listing ON?
  - Does it timeout?
  - Browser crash?
  - Appropriate error message?
- **Mixed Content**: Container with folders and objects
- **Special Characters**: Objects with special characters in names

#### 7. Run Unit Tests
```bash
tox -e py3 -- openstack_dashboard.dashboards.project.containers.tests
```
**Expected**: All tests pass, including new tests for the configuration option.

## Top Challenges in Reviewing This Change

1. **Performance Impact**: Assessing the performance implications of full listing with large object counts.

2. **Default Configuration**: Deciding whether the default should be True or False (likely False for safety).

3. **UI/UX Considerations**: Understanding when full listing is beneficial vs. harmful to user experience.

4. **Browser Limitations**: Large DOM sizes can cause browser performance issues or crashes.

5. **API Efficiency**: Understanding if the implementation uses efficient API calls (e.g., reusing connections, appropriate markers).

6. **Documentation**: Ensuring operators understand the trade-offs and when to use each setting.

## Recommended Steps for Completing the Review

### Phase 1: Code Review (Estimated: 2-2.5 hours)
- **Review the patch**: Examine all 7 files:
  - Where is `SWIFT_PANEL_FULL_LISTING` defined? (settings)
  - How is it used in the Swift panel code?
  - What listing logic changed?
  - Are API calls modified to respect this setting?
  - Documentation updates (example configs, help text)
  - Test additions
- **Check configuration management**: Is the setting properly integrated into Horizon's config system?
- **Review API call logic**: Verify efficient implementation
- **Assess default value**: Is the default appropriate?
- **Documentation review**: Are operators given enough guidance?

### Phase 2: Functional Testing (Estimated: 3-4 hours)
- **Environment setup**: Swift with test data (1 hour if creating large dataset)
- **Test both configurations**: Full listing ON and OFF (1-1.5 hours)
- **Performance testing**: Measure and compare (45-60 minutes)
- **Edge case testing**: Empty containers, very large containers (30-45 minutes)

### Phase 3: Review Feedback (Estimated: 30-45 minutes)
- **Performance assessment**: Document findings
- **Configuration recommendation**: Suggest default and guidance
- **UX evaluation**: Assess user experience impact
- **Provide feedback**: Approve or request changes

## Key Areas of Concern

- **Default Value**: What should the default be? False (safe, performant) or True (complete visibility)?
- **Performance Threshold**: At what object count does full listing become problematic?
- **Browser Limits**: Are there browser limits that could cause crashes or freezes?
- **API Rate Limiting**: Could full listing trigger Swift rate limits?
- **Timeout Handling**: Are timeouts handled gracefully for very large containers?
- **User Expectation**: Do users understand why some containers load slowly with full listing?
- **Configuration Docs**: Is there clear guidance on when to use each setting?
- **Per-Container Setting**: Should this be configurable per-container rather than globally?

## Technology and Testing Framework Background

### Swift Object Storage

Swift is OpenStack's object storage:
- **Containers**: Top-level namespaces (like S3 buckets)
- **Objects**: Files stored in containers
- **Flat Hierarchy**: No real folders (pseudo-folders via naming conventions)

**API Characteristics:**
- **List Objects**: `GET /v1/AUTH_{project}/{container}`
- **Pagination**: Uses `limit` and `marker` parameters
- **Large Datasets**: Can have millions of objects per container

### Swift API Listing

**Paginated Listing:**
```http
GET /v1/AUTH_123/mycontainer?limit=1000
Response: [obj1, obj2, ..., obj1000]

GET /v1/AUTH_123/mycontainer?limit=1000&marker=obj1000
Response: [obj1001, obj1002, ..., obj2000]
```

**Full Listing (Multiple Calls):**
```python
all_objects = []
marker = None
while True:
    response = swift.get(container, marker=marker, limit=1000)
    all_objects.extend(response)
    if len(response) < 1000:
        break  # No more objects
    marker = response[-1]['name']
```

### Horizon Swift Panel

Horizon's Swift panel (`openstack_dashboard.dashboards.project.containers`):
- Lists containers
- Lists objects within containers
- Upload/download objects
- Create/delete containers and objects
- Pseudo-folder navigation

### UI Performance Considerations

**DOM Size Impact:**
- **1,000 objects**: Usually fine
- **10,000 objects**: May cause lag
- **100,000+ objects**: Likely causes severe performance issues or crashes

**Best Practices:**
- Virtual scrolling (render only visible items)
- Pagination
- Lazy loading
- Search/filter to reduce visible set

## Estimated Review Time

- **Complexity Level**: Medium-High
- **Estimated Total Hours**: 5.5-7.5 hours

**Breakdown:**
- **Code Review (Phase 1)**: 2-2.5 hours
- **Functional Testing (Phase 2)**: 3-4 hours
- **Review Feedback & Discussion (Phase 3)**: 30-45 minutes

**Factors affecting time:**
- Swift environment ready: saves 1 hour
- Large test dataset already exists: saves 30-45 minutes
- Familiarity with Swift API: saves 30 minutes
- Need to test extreme cases (10k+ objects): adds 1-2 hours

## Questions to Ask the Author

1. **Motivation**: What specific use case or user request prompted this feature?
2. **Default value**: Why was the chosen default selected?
3. **Performance testing**: What's the largest object count tested with full listing enabled?
4. **Browser testing**: Was this tested with various browsers? Any issues observed?
5. **Timeout handling**: How are timeouts or very large containers handled?
6. **Configuration guidance**: What guidance is provided to operators on when to use each setting?
7. **Per-container option**: Was per-container configuration considered? Why global?
8. **UI enhancements**: Are there any UI improvements to handle large lists (virtual scrolling, etc.)?
9. **Backward compatibility**: Does this change behavior for existing deployments?
10. **Related work**: Are there plans for other Swift panel improvements?
