# My MCP Agents Collection

This repository demonstrates how to build custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) agents for Cursor. It contains four MCP agents that I built to analyze different types of code reviews and project management:

- **github-agent**: Analyzes GitHub Pull Requests
- **opendev-review-agent**: Analyzes OpenDev Gerrit reviews
- **gitlab-rh-agent**: Analyzes GitLab Issues, Merge Requests, and Commits from internal Red Hat GitLab
- **jira-agent**: Provides access to Jira issues, projects, and sprints from Cursor

## AI Assistant Instructions

**⭐ For AI Assistants (Cursor, Claude, etc.): Read this section first!**

### When User Asks to Analyze a Review

**User says any of:**
- "Analyze review [URL]"
- "Analyze OpenDev review [NUMBER]"
- "Fetch and analyze review [URL] with full assessment"
- "Please review https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/965215"

**You should execute this complete workflow:**

#### Step 1: Fetch the Review Code
```bash
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/workspace
./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment opendev [URL]
```

This creates:
- `workspace/[project]-[number]/` - The review code
- `results/review_[number].md` - Assessment template (basic metadata only)

#### Step 2: Query the MCP Agent
```
@opendev-reviewer-agent Analyze the review at [URL]
```

This fetches:
- Review metadata (author, status, commit message)
- File changes and statistics
- Comments and review history

#### Step 3: Analyze the Code
```bash
cd workspace/[project]-[number]
git show HEAD
git log -1
```

Examine:
- What files changed
- What the code does
- Potential issues
- Testing needs
- Security implications

#### Step 4: Complete the Assessment
Update `results/review_[number].md` with:
- **Executive Summary** - What this review does and your recommendation
- **Code Quality Assessment** - Strengths, concerns, suggestions
- **Technical Analysis** - File-by-file analysis
- **Review Checklist** - Code quality, testing, security, performance
- **Testing Verification** - How to test this change
- **Recommendations** - What should be addressed before merge
- **Decision** - Final recommendation (+2/+1/0/-1)

#### Step 5: Report to User
Provide a summary including:
- What the review does
- Key findings (good and bad)
- Your recommendation
- Location of full assessment: `results/review_[number].md`

### Examples

#### Example 1: OpenDev Review
```
User: "Analyze review https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/965215"

You do:
1. cd workspace && ./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment opendev https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/965215
2. @opendev-reviewer-agent Analyze the review at https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/965215
3. cd horizon-965215 && git show HEAD
4. Fill in results/review_965215.md completely
5. Tell user: "✅ Analyzed review 965215. Recommendation: [your verdict]. Full assessment at results/review_965215.md"
```

#### Example 2: GitHub PR
```
User: "Review PR https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/horizon-operator/pull/402"

You do:
1. cd workspace && ./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment github https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/horizon-operator/pull/402
2. @github-reviewer-agent Analyze PR https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/horizon-operator/pull/402
3. cd horizon-operator-pr-402 && git show HEAD
4. Fill in results/review_pr_402.md completely
5. Report findings
```

#### Example 3: GitLab MR
```
User: "Analyze GitLab MR https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/eng/openstack/python-django/-/merge_requests/123"

You do:
1. cd workspace && ./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment gitlab https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/eng/openstack/python-django/-/merge_requests/123
2. @gitlab-cee-agent Analyze the merge request at https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/eng/openstack/python-django/-/merge_requests/123
3. cd python-django-mr-123 && git show HEAD
4. Fill in results/review_mr_123.md completely
5. Report findings
```

### Key Principles

1. **Always run the fetch script first** - Don't just use the MCP agent alone
2. **Always create the assessment document** - Use `--with-assessment` flag
3. **Always read the actual code** - Don't rely only on MCP agent data
4. **Always complete the full template** - Fill in ALL sections of the assessment
5. **Always provide a recommendation** - +2/+1/0/-1 with reasoning

### Available MCP Agents

- `@opendev-reviewer-agent` - For review.opendev.org (Gerrit)
- `@github-reviewer-agent` - For github.com Pull Requests
- `@gitlab-cee-agent` - For gitlab.cee.redhat.com (internal Red Hat)
- `@jiraMcp` - For Jira issues

### Directory Structure You Should Know

```
/home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/
├── workspace/              # Run fetch-review.sh here (gitignored)
├── results/                # Assessment documents go here (can commit)
├── analysis/               # Permanent research (always commit)
└── README.md              # This file
```

### Error Handling

**If fetch-review.sh fails:**
- Check the URL format
- Try manual git clone and fetch

**If MCP agent fails:**
- Continue anyway using git show HEAD
- Note in assessment that MCP data unavailable

**If review is very large:**
- Focus on changed files only
- Summarize rather than detail every file

### Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Fetch review with assessment
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/workspace
./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment opendev [URL]

# View changes
cd [project]-[number]
git show HEAD
git log -1

# Run tests
tox -e pep8

# Complete assessment location
/home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/results/review_[number].md
```

## Complete MCP Configuration
Here is what your **MCP Servers** configuration looks like after you are done following the setup and configuration steps for each one.

To see this:
1. Open Cursor Settings (**Ctrl/Cmd + ,**)
2. Search for: **MCP Servers**
3. Click edit on any one of them

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github-reviewer-agent": {
      "command": "<your-mymcp-cloned-repo-path>/github-agent/server.sh",
      "description": "Analyzes GitHub pull requests to perform automated code review."
    },
    "opendev-reviewer-agent": {
      "command": "<your-mymcp-cloned-repo-path>/opendev-review-agent/server.sh",
      "description": "Analyzes OpenDev Gerrit reviews to perform automated code review."
    },
    "gitlab-cee-agent": {
      "command": "<your-mymcp-cloned-repo-path>/gitlab-rh-agent/server.sh",
      "description": "Agent to fetch and analyze issues/MRs from internal Red Hat GitLab."
    },
    "jiraMcp": {
      "command": "podman",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--env-file",
        "/home/username/.rh-jira-mcp.env",
        "jira-agent:latest"
      ],
      "description": "Provides access to Jira issues, projects, boards, and sprints."
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Save your new mcp.json configuration**  
   Go to **File → Save** and then restart Cursor (**Ctrl+Shift+P** → "Developer: Reload Window")
   
   > **Note**: Alternatively, you can fully exit Cursor (**Ctrl+Q**) and restart it, which will also reload the new settings.

### Testing Each Agent

After configuration, test each agent in Cursor:

**GitHub Agent:**
```
@github-reviewer-agent Review https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/horizon-operator/pull/402
```

**OpenDev Agent:**
```
@opendev-reviewer-agent Analyze https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/960204
```

**GitLab Agent:**
```
@gitlab-cee-agent Analyze commit https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/eng/openstack/python-django/-/commit/848fd870bb51ae6d8ea44512665dab8257f9c27a
```
Or for issues/MRs:
```
@gitlab-cee-agent Analyze issue openstack-konflux/osp-director-operator-17.1/issues/24
```

**Jira Agent:**
```
@jiraMcp Get details for issue OSPRH-13100
```

```

### Workspace for Code Review Analysis

The `workspace/` directory provides a dedicated space for cloning and analyzing code from reviews, PRs, and MRs:

**Quick Start (with automated assessment):**
```bash
# Fetch an OpenDev review with assessment document
cd workspace
./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment opendev https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/965216

# Ask Cursor to complete the assessment
"Please analyze review 965216 and complete results/review_965216.md"
```

**Traditional workflow:**
```bash
# Fetch a GitHub PR
./fetch-review.sh github https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/horizon-operator/pull/402

# Fetch a GitLab MR
./fetch-review.sh gitlab https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/eng/openstack/python-django/-/merge_requests/123
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Organized workspace separate from agent code
- ✅ **NEW:** Automated review assessment document creation
- ✅ Full repository context for deeper analysis
- ✅ Use Cursor's `codebase_search` across review code
- ✅ Git-ignored to avoid cluttering the repo
- ✅ Persistent across sessions

See [`workspace/README.md`](workspace/README.md) and [`workspace/REVIEW_ASSESSMENT_GUIDE.md`](workspace/REVIEW_ASSESSMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed usage instructions.

### Analysis Directory for Permanent Research

The `analysis/` directory stores permanent technical analyses and research findings:

**Purpose:**
- Document research methodology and findings
- Preserve institutional knowledge
- Provide reproducible research
- Cross-reference related work

**Example Analyses:**
- Horizon/Glance direct mode upload implementation
- CORS configuration changes
- Feature migrations and deprecations
- Integration test architecture decisions

**How to Use:**
```bash
# Create a new analysis from template
cd analysis
cp analysis_template.md analysis_<topic>.md

# Query MCP agents for information
@github-reviewer-agent search for [topic]
@opendev-reviewer-agent analyze [review]

# Document findings in your new analysis file
vim analysis_<topic>.md
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Permanent knowledge base (tracked in git)
- ✅ All queries and sources documented
- ✅ Reproducible research methodology
- ✅ Easy onboarding for new team members

See [`analysis/README.md`](analysis/README.md) for detailed guidelines and templates.

### Key Differences Between Agents

**OpenDev, GitHub & GitLab Agents:**
- Simple shell script execution
- Uses `venv` for Python dependencies
- Direct server.py execution
- Environment files for API tokens (.env)

**Jira Agent:**
- Containerized deployment with Podman
- Uses `--env-file` for credentials
- Runs in isolated container environment
- More secure (credentials never in config file)
- 20+ tools for comprehensive Jira integration
