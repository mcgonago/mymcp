# Review Assessment Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

The workspace now supports **automated review assessment document creation** when fetching reviews.

---

## New Feature: `--with-assessment`

### Usage

```bash
./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment opendev https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/965216
```

### What It Does

1. **Fetches the review** (as usual)
2. **Extracts metadata** from git:
   - Commit subject/title
   - Author name and email
   - Commit date
   - Files changed count
   - Lines added/deleted
3. **Creates `review_965216.md`** pre-filled with:
   - Review information section (complete)
   - Empty sections marked `[To be populated by Cursor]`
   - Comprehensive assessment template
   - Verification commands

### Result

You get a **ready-to-analyze** assessment document that Cursor can fill in automatically.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Review

```bash
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp/workspace
./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment opendev https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/horizon/+/965216
```

**Output:**
```
âœ“ Review assessment created: results/review_965216.md
  Next: Ask Cursor to analyze and fill in the assessment
  Try: 'Please analyze review 965216 and complete results/review_965216.md'
```

### Step 2: Ask Cursor to Analyze

**In Cursor:**
```
Please analyze review 965216 and complete results/review_965216.md
```

**Cursor will:**
- Read the code in `horizon-965216/`
- Examine `git show HEAD`
- Fill in all assessment sections
- Provide recommendation (+2/+1/0/-1)

### Step 3: Review and Act

- Review Cursor's assessment
- Run suggested tests
- Post comments to Gerrit
- Vote on the review

## Example Usage

### Basic Assessment
```bash
./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment opendev [url]
```

**Creates:**
- `horizon-965216/` (review code in workspace/)
- `../results/review_965216.md` (assessment at top level)

### Complete Setup
```bash
./fetch-review.sh --with-assessment --all opendev [url]
```

**Creates:**
- `horizon-965216/` (review code in workspace/)
- `horizon-master/` (master for comparison in workspace/)
- `horizon-965216-experiment/` (experiment area in workspace/)
- `../results/review_965216.md` (assessment at top level)

**Best for:** Comprehensive code reviews

## Integration with Analysis Directory

For permanent documentation:

```bash
# Complete the assessment
"Please analyze review 965216 and complete results/review_965216.md"

# Option 1: Commit the assessment in results/
cd /home/omcgonag/Work/mymcp
git add results/review_965216.md
git commit -m "Add assessment for review 965216"

# Option 2: Promote to permanent analysis
cp results/review_965216.md analysis/
git add analysis/review_965216.md
git commit -m "Add assessment for review 965216"
```
